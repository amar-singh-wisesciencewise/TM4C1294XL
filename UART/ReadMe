A simple UART working code for the TM4C1294XL board

This code initializes the UART0 on PortA
Here we are also enabling the Loop-back feature available for debuging - In Loop-Back Tx is feebacked to Rx.
so we would not need any other board with UART for testing; one can also initialize another UART available on TM4C1294XL and connect the two

UART0 is initialized for:
PORT0;
Baud Rate: 115200
NO PARITY;
NO BREAK;
1 STOP BIT;
NO FIFO;
NO INTERRUPT;
